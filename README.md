# Theater

Windows 10 global *theater mode*.

Utility to dim all screens when focusing on some applications, especially useful when gaming on multiple monitors and not wanting to get distracted with the other screens being full bright

## TODO
- UI: Support adding and removing target processes through a dialog box
- UI: Support setting the target transparency
- UI: Support customizing the fade in/out animations
- CONFIG: Add support for YAML or JSON based config files
- OPTIM: Cache window handles / process IDs in some ways with their associated process?
